This is my personal set up for ENB (http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrim.htm) and ReShade (https://reshade.me/) for Skyrim.

I put it on GitHub more as a backup than to share it, but if anyone wants to use it, go ahead.
It hasn't been really tested yet so I can't promise it will work, but I am happy with the results so far.

I have been developing it to give Skyrim a rougher, grimier look. The atmosphere I have in mind is that of Hellblade, Vikings, Heilung and nicely summarized by this unoffocial video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6Yahh_I7IE&ab_channel=LITVINOV).

I started with a combination of these two ENB setups as a base, but I deviated enough from either of them to start calling this setup my own.
It provides a fast Depth of Field effect for distant landscapes, a weather based configuration on top of global settings, and a good balance between a desaturated atmosphere in rainy weather and a colorful one in sunny weather.

The ReShade layer is there to add touches I wasn't able to accomplish with the ENB layer (tilt shift effect on the edges, a better HDR glow, a more balanced saturation control and sharpness effect, and a cinematic color grading).
